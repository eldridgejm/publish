# there are several types of smart dates:
#
#   - direct reference;
#       "due"
#   - delta reference (before or after), (days or hours);
#       "7 days before due", "7 days after due"
#   - day of given week;
#       "monday of week 2"
#   - first available (before or after);
#       "first monday, wednesday, or friday after previous.release",
#       "first monday, wednesday, or friday before previous.released"
#
# any of these can have a time appended. for example:
#
#   - due at 23:59:00
#   - 7 days before due at 23:59:00
#   - monday of week 02 at 23:59:00
#   - first monday, wednesday, or friday after previous.release at 23:59:00
